## Instructions

This assessment: (1) evaluates the ability to conduct motivated hypothesis testing on a dataset, which can be the same as the Assessment #1 dataset, or another; and (2) awareness of how datasets can conceal bias or misrepresent a phenomenon.

-   [ ] Hypothesis selection and testing should be motivated, to the extent that it draws on existing academic literature and thinking --- students should avoid uninformed speculation.
-   [ ] It should also be technically proficient and accompanied by explanations of the procedures used. Awareness of how datasets can conceal or bias or misrepresent a phenomenon should also be supported by reference to other datasets and the academic literature; it is not enough to merely register the ways in which a dataset could be biased.

---

-   [ ] (1) conducts three or more different hypothesis tests on the dataset previously submitted (or another); and
-   [ ] (2) evaluates the normative factors that should be considered when engaging with this dataset.
-   [ ] The hypothesis tests should be supported by short reflections on why these hypotheses (and not others) make sense in the context of this dataset.

---

-   [ ] Be able to make informed choices about different approaches to hypothesis testing

    -   [ ] OK
        -   [ ] Be aware of the nature of hypothesis testing and where can be appropriately applied (or misapplied)
        -   [ ] Research and reference academic resources from the relevant literature to generate hypotheses, using the APA referencing style.
        -   [ ] Consider and evaluate the plausibility of any results obtained or not obtained
    -   [ ] Excel
        -   [ ] Demonstrate a high level grasp of basic principles tatistical thinking
        -   [ ] Give evidence of wider research into the philosophy of statistical inference, and how it impacts on the hypotheses conducted.
        -   [ ] Generate novel but well-grounded insights with respect to the data analysed

-   [ ] Translate data from a numerical modality to a visual or linguistic one

    -   [ ] OK
        -   [ ] Show a technical ability to translate between different forms of data in a way that fosters insight and preserves accuracy.
    -   [ ] Excel
        -   [ ] Demonstrate learning that goes beyond the material taught in credible ways

-   [ ] Identify how data visualisations can encode bias.

    -   [ ] OK
        -   [ ] Demonstrate awareness of how visualizations can foster misleading conclusions.
    -   [ ] Excel
        -   [ ] Show how an existing academic publication on the same or similar datasets reproduces bias in a way that is credible
